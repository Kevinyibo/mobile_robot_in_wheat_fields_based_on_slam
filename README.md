# mobile_robot_in_wheat_fields_based_on_slam
We have developed an autonomous ground mobile robot that can use laser SLAM to construct a 2D occupation grid map of wheat fields. Subsequently, the robot's localization, path planning, and motion control are achieved using the map, 2D point clouds, and wheel odometry, enabling the robot to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles in wheat fields.
